## What and Why?
We propose a mobile web application that creates personalized meal plans for health-conscious users and patients with specific dietary needs (such as cancer, diabetes, or kidney disease). The system adapts to individual goals, weight loss, recovery, or balanced nutrition, and helps reduce food waste by planning meals around ingredients already available at home.

This is important because many people struggle to manage diet, health conditions, and grocery budgets at the same time. Patients often require symptom-friendly foods, fitness-minded users want to track macros, and busy families or students need quick, affordable meals. Current solutions are fragmented, and none provide a simple, accessible way to meet all these needs in one place.

## For Whom?
- Patients with chronic illness who need symptom-friendly dietary suggestions.  
- Health-conscious individuals managing fitness, recovery, or weight goals.  
- Busy families and students looking for affordable, healthy, low-waste meal plans.  

## How?
From an end-user perspective, the system will:

- **Nutrition & meal data:** Use USDA FoodData Central for nutrition information and TheMealDB for recipes. Combine the two to provide both meals and accurate calorie/macro data.  
- **Barcode scanning:** Scan products with the phone camera using ZXing/Quagga and fetch product details from Open Food Facts (free barcode/product database).  
- **Meal planning:** Generate a 7-day plan that prioritizes pantry ingredients first to minimize food waste and align with the userâ€™s dietary goals.  
- **Symptom-based suggestions:** Users log symptoms (e.g., nausea, fatigue), and the app provides rule-based food recommendations (with a disclaimer that this is educational, not medical advice).  
- **Exports:** Allow users to export plans and logs as PDF or CSV for sharing with dietitians, doctors, or caregivers.  

### Additional features (stretch goals):
- **Receipt OCR:** Use Tesseract.js to add pantry items directly from receipts.  
- **Chatbot:** Provide simple Q&A through a rule-based system, with the option to later upgrade to a free chatbot framework.  
- **Caregiver/Shared accounts:** Let caregivers or family members view meal plans.  

*(Note: The APIs listed above are some suggested free options; the team may explore alternatives as needed.)*

## Scope
We believe this project is appropriately scoped for a semester-long effort by a team of 4-6 developers.  

- **Phase 1** focuses on the core: ingredient tracking, meal planning, and nutrition database integration. These features are substantial but achievable within the timeframe.  
- **Phase 2** introduces stretch goals such as symptom-aware suggestions and healthcare provider integration if time permits.  

The technical work, API integration, database management, and mobile-responsive design, seems moderately complex but manageable, without requiring advanced AI or full medical system integration.  

In our view, the project balances feasibility with innovation by leveraging established nutrition APIs while adding a novel symptom-awareness layer that differentiates it from existing apps.
